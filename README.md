## What is this book about?
Roblox is a massively popular online gaming platform, but it can be challenging to maneuver for beginners who don’t know where to start, as well as seasoned developers who tend to struggle with limited scripting tools that make transitioning from other platforms such as Unity more difficult.
	
This book covers the following exciting features:
* Master the basics of game building using Roblox Studio tools
* Execute essential pre-production steps, such as layout and grayboxing, to plan and build your map effectively
* Strategically place props to create immersive environments
* Incorporate lighting, atmosphere, and VFX, such as particle beams, trails, and smoke, to add visual appeal and depth to your game
* Prioritize optimization, updates, and user experience to ensure your game’s success
* Monetize your gaming experience and learn how to earn Robux through in-game purchases and other methods
